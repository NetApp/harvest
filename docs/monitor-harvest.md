## Harvest Metadata

Harvest publishes metadata metrics about the key components of Harvest.
Many of these metrics are used in the `Harvest Metadata` dashboard.

If you want to understand more about these metrics, read on!

Metrics are published for:

- collectors
- pollers
- clusters being monitored
- exporters

Here's a high-level summary of the metadata metrics Harvest publishes with details below.

| metadata_exporter_time         | amount of time it took to render, export, and serve exported data            | microseconds |
| metadata_target_goroutines     | number of goroutines that exist within the poller                            | scalar       |
| metadata_target_status         | status of the system being monitored. 0 means reachable, 1 means unreachable | enum         |

## Collector Metadata

A poller publishes the metadata metrics for each collector and exporter associated with it.

Let's say we start a poller with the `Zapi` collector and the out-of-the-box `default.yaml` exporting metrics to
Prometheus. That means you will be monitoring 22 different objects (uncommented lines in `default.yaml` as of 23.02).

When we start this poller, we expect it to export 23 `metadata_component_status` metrics. 
One for each of the 22 objects, plus one for the Prometheus exporter.

The following `curl` confirms there are 23 `metadata_component_status` metrics reported.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:12990/metrics | grep -v "#" | grep metadata_component_status | wc -l
      23
```

These metrics also tell us which collectors are in an standby or failed state. 
For example, filtering on components not in the `running` state shows the following since this cluster doesn't have any `ClusterPeers`, `SecurityAuditDestinations`, or `SnapMirrors`. The `reason` is listed as `no instances` and the metric value is 1 which means standby. 

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:12990/metrics | grep -v "#" | grep metadata_component_status | grep -Evo "running"
metadata_component_status{name="Zapi", reason="no instances",target="ClusterPeer",type="collector",version="23.04.1417"} 1
metadata_component_status{name="Zapi", reason="no instances",target="SecurityAuditDestination",type="collector",version="23.04.1417"} 1
metadata_component_status{name="Zapi", reason="no instances",target="SnapMirror",type="collector",version="23.04.1417"} 1
```

The log files for the poller show a similar story. The poller starts with 22 collectors, but drops to 19 after three of the collectors go to standby because there are no instances to collect. 

```bash
2023-04-17T13:14:18-04:00 INF ./poller.go:539 > updated status, up collectors: 22 (of 22), up exporters: 1 (of 1) Poller=u2
2023-04-17T13:14:18-04:00 INF collector/collector.go:342 > no instances, entering standby Poller=u2 collector=Zapi:SecurityAuditDestination task=data
2023-04-17T13:14:18-04:00 INF collector/collector.go:342 > no instances, entering standby Poller=u2 collector=Zapi:ClusterPeer task=data
2023-04-17T13:14:18-04:00 INF collector/collector.go:342 > no instances, entering standby Poller=u2 collector=Zapi:SnapMirror task=data
2023-04-17T13:15:18-04:00 INF ./poller.go:539 > updated status, up collectors: 19 (of 22), up exporters: 1 (of 1) Poller=u2
```
