# Prepare E-Series Systems

!!! note "Beta Feature"
    E-Series monitoring support is new in Harvest and should be considered beta.
    Feedback and bug reports are welcome on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/discussions).

NetApp E-Series storage systems with REST API support can be monitored directly by Harvest. This guide covers the setup required to prepare your E-Series array.

## Monitor Role Requirements

For Harvest monitoring, use a user with the **Monitor** role.
**Official Documentation:** [View Local User Roles](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/e-series-santricity/sm-settings/view-local-user-roles.html)

For E-Series configuration in Harvest, see [Configure E-Series](/configure-eseries/).
