# Welcome to Harvest

## Introduction to NetApp Harvest

> The open-metrics endpoint for ONTAP and StorageGRID

NetApp Harvest collects metrics from remote clusters, summarizes it, and stores it in metrics servers.

The default package collects performance, capacity and hardware metrics from ONTAP and StorageGRID clusters. 
Metrics are delivered to Prometheus and InfluxDB databases - and displayed in Grafana dashboards.
New metrics can be added by editing the config files.

Harvest offers great flexibility in how it collects, augments, and exports data.  
You are more than welcome to contribute your own collector, plugin or exporter.
