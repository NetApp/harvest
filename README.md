# What is NetApp Harvest?

> Harvest is the open-metrics endpoint for ONTAP, StorageGRID, E-Series and Cisco Nexus Switches

NetApp Harvest brings observability to ONTAP, StorageGRID, E-Series and Cisco Nexus Switches by collecting performance, capacity and hardware metrics,
transforming them and routing them to your choice of a time-series database.

The included Grafana dashboards deliver the datacenter insights you need, while
new metrics can be collected with a few edits of the included template files.

Harvest is open-source, built with Go, released under an [Apache2 license](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/blob/main/LICENSE),
and offers [great flexibility](ARCHITECTURE.md) in how you collect, augment, and export your datacenter metrics.

To get started, follow our quickstart guide or install Harvest.
