## v1.5.1

- Add [`FromMap`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/zekroTJA/timedmap#FromMap) constructor which can be used to create a `TimedMap` from an existing map with the given expiration values for each key-value pair.

## v1.4.0

  â†’ Hence, **`SetExpire` is now deprecated and will be removed in the next version.** Please use `SetExpires` instead.

- Make use of `sync.Pool` to re-use `element` instances instead of creating new ones on each new element creation and passing them to the GC after deletion.

## v1.3.1
