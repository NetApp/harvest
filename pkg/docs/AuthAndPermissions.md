# Authentication

The collector requires an authentication (`auth_style`) method to connect to the ONTAP server. This can be either `basic_auth` or `certificate_auth`. It is highly recommended to create a read-only harvest user on your ONTAP server and use certificate-based TLS authentication.

## Creating ONTAP user
There are two ways to create a read-only user:
* Create a user with read-only access to **all** API objects
* Limit the harvest user to the handful of APIs that Harvest collects

The second option has a smaller attack surface, but each time you want to collect counters of a new object, you will need to update the user's privileges.

Below we explain how to create an ONTAP user and role for Harvest using ONTAP System Manager (Classic interface & New interface) and CLI.

### System Manager: New interface

*Note: in this section we add a user with read-access to all API objects. For limited access, use either the classic interface or the CLI*


Open System Manager. Click on *CLUSTER* in the left menu bar, *Settings* and *Users and Roles*.
<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_sm_0.png" width="75%"></center>

In the right column, under *Roles*, click on *Add* to add a new role.
<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_sm_1.png" width="75%"></center>

Choose a role name (e.g. *harvest2-role*). In the *REST API PATH* field type */api* and select *Read-Only* as for *ACCESS*. Click on *Save*. 

<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_sm_2.png" width="75%"></center>

In the left column, under *Users*, click on *Add* to create a new user. Choose a username. Under *Role*, select the role that we just created. Under *User Login Methods* select *ONTAPI*, and select one of the two authentication methods. Type in a password if you chose *Password*. Click on *Save*
<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_sm_3.png" width="75%"></center>

If you chose *Password*, you can add the username and password to the Harvest configuration file and start Harvest. If you chose *Certificate* jump to [Using Certificate Authentication](#using-certificate-authentication) to generate certificates files.


### System Manager: Classic interface

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

Open System Manager. Click on the Settings icon on the top-right corner of the window.
<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_smc_0.png" width="75%"></center>

Click on *Roles* in the left menu bar and click *Add*. Choose a role name (e.g. *harvest2-role*).

<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_smc_1.png" width="75%"></center>

If you want to give Harvest read access to **all** API objects, then under *Role Attributes* click on *Add*, under *Command* type *DEFAULT*, leave *Query* empty, select *readonly* under *Access Level*, click on *OK* and *Add*.

If you want to limit the API objects, then under *Role Attributes*, add each of the following lines as an entry. All of those should be entered under the *Command* column, *Query* should be left blank, and *Access Level* should be selected *readonly*.

* cluster
* lun
* snapmirror
* statistics
* storage aggregate
* storage disk
* storage shelf
* system node
* version
* volume

After you click on *Add*, this is what you should see:

<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_smc_2.png" width="75%"></center>

Now we need to create a user. Click on *Users* in the left menu bar and *Add*. Choose a username and password. Under *User Login Methods*, click on *Add*, select *ontapi* as *Application* and select the role that we just created as *Role*. Click on *Add* in the pop-up window to save.

<center><img src="examples/ontap_user_smc_3.png" width="75%"></center>

Now add the username and password to `harvest.yml` and start Harvest.

</details>

### ONTAP CLI

We are going to:
- create a Harvest role with read-only access to the API objects
- create a Harvest user and assign it to the role

You should decide if you want to limit the Harvest role to only the subset of API objects Harvest requires or 
give Harvest access to all API objects. In both cases, Harvest's access will be read-only.

Either approach is fine, following the principle of least-privilege, we recommend the limited approach.

Login to the CLI of your c-DOT ONTAP system using SSH.

#### Least-privilege approach

Verify there are no errors when you copy/paste these. Warnings are fine.

```bash
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "cluster"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "lun"    
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "qos workload show"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "snapmirror"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "statistics"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "storage aggregate"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "storage disk"     
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "storage shelf"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "system health status show" 
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "system health subsystem show"  
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "system node"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "version"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "volume"

# Permissions required for Harvest 22.05+ security dashboard
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "network interface"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "security"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "storage encryption disk"
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "vserver"
```

#### All APIs read-only approach

```bash
security login role create -role harvest2-role -access readonly -cmddirname "DEFAULT"
```

#### Create harvest user and associate to role

Use this for password authentication

```bash
# ZAPI based access
security login create -user-or-group-name harvest2 -application ontapi -role harvest2-role -authentication-method password

# REST based access
security login create -user-or-group-name harvest2 -application http -role harvest2-role -authentication-method password   
```

Or this for certificate authentication

```bash
security login create -user-or-group-name harvest2 -application ontapi \
 -role harvest2-role -authentication-method cert
```

#### 7-Mode CLI
Login to the CLI of your 7-Mode ONTAP system (e.g. using SSH). First, we create a user role. If you want to give the user readonly access to **all** API objects, type in the following command:

```bash
useradmin role modify harvest2-role -a login-http-admin,api-system-get-version, \
api-system-get-info,api-perf-object-*,api-ems-autosupport-log,api-diagnosis-status-get, \
api-lun-list-info,api-diagnosis-subsystem-config-get-iter,api-disk-list-info, \
api-diagnosis-config-get-iter,api-aggr-list-info,api-volume-list-info, \
api-storage-shelf-environment-list-info,api-qtree-list,api-quota-report
```


# Using Certificate Authentication

See [comments here for troubleshooting](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/314#issuecomment-882120238) client certificate authentication.

Client certificate authentication allows you to authenticate with your ONTAP cluster without including username/passwords in your `harvest.yml` file. The process to setup client certificates is straightforward, although self-signed certificates introduce more work as does Go's strict treatment of common names.

Unless you've installed production certificates on your ONTAP cluster, you'll need to replace your cluster's common-name-based self-signed certificates with a subject alternative name based certificate. After that step is completed, we'll create client certificates and add those for passwordless login.

If you can't or don't want to replace your ONTAP cluster certificates, there are some workarounds. You can
-  Use `use_insecure_tls: true` in your `harvest.yml` to disable certificate verification
-  Change your `harvest.yml` to connect via hostname instead of IP address

## Create Self-Signed Subject Alternate Name Certificates for ONTAP

Subject alternate name (SAN) certificates allow multiple hostnames in a single certificate. Starting with Go 1.3, when connecting to a cluster via its IP address, the CN field in the server certificate is ignored. This often causes errors like this:
`x509: cannot validate certificate for 127.0.0.1 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs`

### Overview of steps to create a self-signed SAN certificate and make ONTAP use it

1. Create a root key
2. Create a root certificate authority certificate
3. Create a SAN certificate for your ONTAP cluster, using #2 to create it
4. Install root ca certificate created in step #2 on cluster
5. Install SAN certificate created in step #3 on your cluster
6. Modify you cluster/SVM to use the new certificate installed at step #5

#### Setup
```
# create a place to store the certificate authority files, adjust as needed
mkdir -p ca/{private,certs}
```
#### Create a root key
```
cd ca
# generate a private key that we will use to create our self-signed certificate authority
openssl genrsa -out private/ca.key.pem 4096
chmod 400 private/ca.key.pem
```

#### Create a root certificate authority certificate

Download the sample [samples/openssl.cnf] file and put it in the directory we created in [setup](#setup). Edit line 9, changing `dir` to point to your `ca` directory created in [setup](#setup).

```
openssl req -config openssl.cnf -key private/ca.key.pem -new -x509 -days 7300 -sha256 -extensions v3_ca -out certs/ca.cert.pem

# Verify
openssl x509 -noout -text -in certs/ca.cert.pem

# Make sure these are present
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption               <======== Signature Algorithm can not be sha-1
        X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: 
                --removed
            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier: 
                --removed

            X509v3 Basic Constraints: critical
                CA:TRUE                                        <======== CA must be true
            X509v3 Key Usage: critical
                Digital Signature, Certificate Sign, CRL Sign  <======== Digital and certificate signature
```

#### Create a SAN certificate for your ONTAP cluster

First, we'll create the certificate signing request and then the certificate. In this example, the ONTAP cluster is named `umeng-aff300-05-06`, update accordingly.

Download the sample [samples/server_cert.cnf] file and put it in the directory we created in [setup](#setup). Edit lines 18-21 to include your ONTAP cluster hostnames and IP addresses. Edit lines 6-11 with new names as needed.

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -subj "/" -config server_cert.cnf -outform pem -out umeng-aff300-05-06.csr -keyout umeng-aff300-05-06.key

# Verify
openssl req -text -noout -in umeng-aff300-05-06.csr

# Make sure these are present
        Attributes:
        Requested Extensions:
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:         <======== Section that lists alternate DNS and IP names
                DNS:umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com, DNS:umeng-aff300-05-06, IP Address:10.193.48.11, IP Address:10.193.48.11
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption     <======== Signature Algorithm can not be sha-1
```

We'll now use the certificate signing request and the recently create certificate authority to create a new SAN certificate for our cluster.

```
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 30 -in umeng-aff300-05-06.csr -CA certs/ca.cert.pem -CAkey private/ca.key.pem -CAcreateserial -out umeng-aff300-05-06.crt -extensions req_ext -extfile server_cert.cnf

# Verify
openssl x509 -text -noout -in umeng-aff300-05-06.crt

# Make sure these are present
X509v3 extensions:
            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name:       <======== Section that lists alternate DNS and IP names
                DNS:umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com, DNS:umeng-aff300-05-06, IP Address:10.193.48.11, IP Address:10.193.48.11
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption   <======== Signature Algorithm can not be sha-1
```

#### Install Root CA Certificate On Cluster

Login to your cluster with admin credentials and install the server certificate authority.

```
ssh admin@IP
umeng-aff300-05-06::*> security certificate install -type server-ca

Please enter Certificate: Press <Enter> when done
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

You should keep a copy of the CA-signed digital certificate for future reference.

The installed certificate's CA and serial number for reference:
CA: ntap
Serial: 46AFFC7A3A9999999E8FB2FEB0

The certificate's generated name for reference: ntap
```

Now install the server certificate we created above with SAN.

```
umeng-aff300-05-06::*> security certificate install -type server

Please enter Certificate: Press <Enter> when done
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
..
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

Please enter Private Key: Press <Enter> when done
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----

Please enter certificates of Certification Authorities (CA) which form the certificate chain of the server certificate. This starts with the issuing CA certificate of the server certificate and can range up to the root CA certificate.

Do you want to continue entering root and/or intermediate certificates {y|n}: n
```

If ONTAP tells you the provided certificate does not have a common name in the subject field, type the hostname of the cluster like this:
```
The provided certificate does not have a common name in the subject field.

Enter a valid common name to continue installation of the certificate:

Enter a valid common name to continue installation of the certificate: umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com

You should keep a copy of the private key and the CA-signed digital certificate for future reference.

The installed certificate's CA and serial number for reference:
CA: ntap
Serial: 67A94AA25B229A68AC5BABACA8939A835AA998A58

The certificate's generated name for reference: umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com
```

#### Modify the admin SVM to use the new certificate

We'll modify the cluster's admin SVM to use the just installed server certificate and certificate authority.

```
vserver show -type admin -fields vserver,type
vserver            type
------------------ -----
umeng-aff300-05-06 admin

umeng-aff300-05-06::*> ssl modify -vserver umeng-aff300-05-06 -server-enabled true -serial 67A94AA25B229A68AC5BABACA8939A835AA998A58 -ca ntap
  (security ssl modify)
```

You can verify the certificate(s) are installed and working by using `openssl` like so:
```
openssl s_client -CAfile certs/ca.cert.pem -showcerts -servername server -connect umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com:443

CONNECTED(00000005)
depth=1 C = US, ST = NC, L = RTP, O = ntap, OU = ntap
verify return:1
depth=0 
verify return:1
...
```

without the `-CAfile`, `openssl` will report
```
CONNECTED(00000005)
depth=0 
verify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate
verify return:1
depth=0 
verify error:num=21:unable to verify the first certificate
verify return:1
---
```

## Create Client Certificates for Password-less Login

Copy the server certificate we created above into the Harvest install directory.

```
cp ca/umeng-aff300-05-06.crt /opt/harvest
cd /opt/harvest
```

Create a self-signed client key and certificate with the same name as the hostname where Harvest is running. It's not required to name the key/cert pair after the hostname, but if you do, Harvest will load them automatically when you specify `auth_style: certificate_auth` otherwise you can point to them directly. See [Pollers](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest#pollers) for details.

Change the common name to the ONTAP user you setup with the harvest role above. e.g `harvest2`

```
cd /opt/harvest
mkdir cert
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1095 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout cert/$(hostname).key -out cert/$(hostname).pem -subj "/CN=harvest2"
```

## Install Client Certificates on Cluster

Login to your cluster with admin credentials and install the client certificate.

```
ssh admin@IP
umeng-aff300-05-06::*>  security certificate install -type client-ca -vserver umeng-aff300-05-06

Please enter Certificate: Press <Enter> when done
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

You should keep a copy of the CA-signed digital certificate for future reference.

The installed certificate's CA and serial number for reference:
CA: cbg
Serial: B77B59444444CCCC

The certificate's generated name for reference: cbg_B77B59444444CCCC
```

Now that the client certificate is installed, let's enable it.
```
umeng-aff300-05-06::*> ssl modify -vserver umeng-aff300-05-06 -client-enabled true
  (security ssl modify)
```

Verify with a recent version of `curl`. If you are runnin on a Mac [see below]().

```
curl --cacert umeng-aff300-05-06.crt --key cert/$(hostname).key --cert cert/$(hostname).pem https://umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com/api/storage/disks
```

## Update Harvest.yml to use client certificates

Update the poller section with `auth_style: certificate_auth` like this:

```
  u2-cert: 
    auth_style: certificate_auth
    addr: umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com
```

Restart your poller and enjoy your password-less life-style.

### macOS 

The version of `curl` installed on macOS up through Monterey is not recent enough to work with self-signed SAN certs. You will need to install a newer version of `curl` via Homebrew, MacPorts, source, etc.

Example of failure when running with older version of `curl` - you will see this in [client auth](#install-client-certificates-on-cluster) test step above.
```
curl --version
curl 7.64.1 (x86_64-apple-darwin20.0) libcurl/7.64.1 (SecureTransport) LibreSSL/2.8.3 zlib/1.2.11 nghttp2/1.41.0

curl --cacert umeng-aff300-05-06.crt --key cert/cgrindst-mac-0.key --cert cert/cgrindst-mac-0.pem https://umeng-aff300-05-06-cm.rtp.openenglab.netapp.com/api/storage/disks

curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
```

Let's install `curl` via Homebrew. Make sure you don't miss the message that Homebrew prints about your path.
```
If you need to have curl first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH"' >> /Users/cgrindst/.bash_profile
```

Now when we make an client auth request with our self-signed certificate it works! `\o/`

```
brew install curl

curl --version

Change directory to your Harvest home directory (replace `/opt/harvest/` if this is not the default):

```bash
$ cd /opt/harvest/
```

Generate an SSL cert and key pair with the following command. Note that it's preferred to generate these files using the hostname of the local machine. The command below assumes `debian8` as our hostname name and `harvest2` as the user we created in the previous step:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 1095 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout cert/debian8.key \
 -out cert/debian8.pem  -subj "/CN=harvest2"
```

Next, open the public key (`debian8.pem` in our example) and copy all of its content. Login into your ONTAP CLI and run this command by replacing **CLUSTER** with the name of your cluster. 

```bash
security certificate install -type client-ca -vserver CLUSTER
```

Paste the public key content and hit enter. Output should be similar to this:

```bash
jamaica::> security certificate install -type client-ca -vserver jamaica 

Please enter Certificate: Press <Enter> when done

-----END CERTIFICATE-----


You should keep a copy of the CA-signed digital certificate for future reference.

The installed certificate's CA and serial number for reference:
CA: harvest2
Serial: 3FD1145F2976043012213d3009095534CCRDBD2

The certificate's generated name for reference: harvest2
```

Finally, we need to enable SSL authentication with the following command (replace **CLUSTER** with the name of your cluster):

```bash
security ssl modify -client-enabled true -vserver CLUSTER
```
