# This template exists to prevent double exporting of aggregate efficiency metrics when
# using both the Rest and Zapi collectors, in that order.
# The Zapi collector exports aggregate efficiency objects via the AggregateEfficiency template
# while the REST collector exports them via the Aggregate template. That means the normal object/collector dedup logic
# won't handle these metrics.
