[Releases](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/releases)

## 21.08.0 / 2021-08-31
<!-- git log --no-merges --cherry-pick --right-only --oneline release/21.05.4...release/21.08.0 -->

This major release introduces a Docker workflow that makes it a breeze to
standup Grafana, Prometheus, and Harvest with auto-provisioned dashboards. There
are seven new dashboards, example Prometheus alerts, and a bunch of fixes
detailed below. We haven't forgotten about our 7-mode customers either and have
a number of improvements in 7-mode dashboards with more to come.

This release Harvest also sports the most external contributions to date.
:metal: Thanks!

With 284 commits since 21.05, there is a lot to summarize! Make sure you check out the full list of enhancements and improvements in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) since 21.05.

**IMPORTANT** Harvest relies on the autosupport sidecar binary to periodically
send usage and support telemetry data to NetApp by default. Usage of the
harvest-autosupport binary falls under the NetApp [EULA](autosupport/NetApp-EULA.md).
Automatic sending of this data can be disabled with the `autosupport_disabled`
option. See [Autosupport](autosupport) for details.

**IMPORTANT** RPM and Debian packages will be deprecated in the future, replaced
with Docker and native binaries. See
[#330](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/330) for details and tell us
what you think. Several of you have already weighed-in. Thanks! If you haven't,
please do.

**Known Issues**

We've improved several of the 7-mode dashboards this release, but there are still a number of gaps with 7-mode dashboards when compared to c-mode. We will address these in a point release by splitting the c-mode and 7-mode dashboards. See [#423](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/423) for details.

On RHEL and Debian, the example Unix collector does not work at the moment due to the `harvest` user lacking permissions to read the `/proc` filesystem. See [#249](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/249) for details.

## 21.05.3 / 2021-06-28

This release introduces a significantly simplified way to connect Harvest and Prometheus, improves Harvest builds times by 7x, reduces executable sizes by 3x, enables cross compiling support, and includes several Grafana dashboard and collector fixes.

**Known Issues**

On RHEL and Debian, the example Unix collector does not work at the moment due to the `harvest` user lacking permissions to read the `/proc` filesystem. See [#249](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/249) for details.

### Enhancements
- Create Prometheus port range exporter that allows you to connect multiple pollers to Prometheus without needing to specify a port-per-poller. This makes it much easier to connect Prometheus and Harvest; especially helpful when you're monitoring many clusters [#172](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/172)

- Improve Harvest build times by 7x and reduce executable sizes by 3x [#100](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/100)
 
- Improve containerization with the addition of a poller-per-container Dockerfile. Create a new subcommand `harvest generate docker` which generates a `docker-compose.yml` file for all pollers defined in your config

- Improve systemd integration by using instantiated units for each poller and a harvest target to tie them together. Create a new subcommand `harvest generate systemd` which generates a Harvest systemd target for all pollers defined in your config [#systemd](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/tree/main/service/contrib)
  
- Harvest doctor checks that all Prometheus exporters specify a unique port [#118](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/118)
  
- Harvest doctor warns when an unknown exporter type is specified (likely a spelling error) [#118](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/118)
  
- Add Harvest [CUE](https://cuelang.org/) validation and type-checking [#208](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/pull/208)
  
- `bin/zapi` uses the `--config` command line option to read the harvest config file. This brings this tool inline with other Harvest tools. This makes it easier to switch between multiple sets of harvest.yml files.
  
- Harvest no longer writes pidfiles; simplifying management code and install [#159](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/pull/159)

### Fixes
- Ensure that the Prometheus exporter does not create duplicate labels [#132](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/132)

- Ensure that the Prometheus exporter includes `HELP` and `TYPE` metatags when requested. Some tools require these [#104](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/104)
      
- Disk status should return zero for a failed disk and one for a healthy disk. Thanks to @hashi825 for reporting and fixing [#182](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/182)

- Lun info should be collected by Harvest. Thanks to @hashi825 for reporting and fixing [#230](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/230)

- Grafana dashboard units, typo, and filtering fixes. Thanks to @mamoep, @matejzero, and @florianmulatz for reporting these :tada: [#184](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/184) [#186](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/186) [#190](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/190) [#192](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/192) [#195](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/195) [#202](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/202)

- Unix collector should not panic when harvest.yml is changed [#160](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/160)

- Reduce log noise about poller lagging behind by few milliseconds. Thanks @hashi825 [#214](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/214)

- Don't assume debug when foregrounding the poller process. Thanks to @florianmulatz for reporting. [#246](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/issues/246)

- Improve Docker all-in-one-container argument handling and simplify building in air gapped environments. Thanks to @optiz0r for reporting these issues and creating fixes. [#166](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/pull/166) [#167](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/pull/167) [#168](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest/pull/168)

## 21.05.1 / 2021-05-20

Announcing the release of Harvest2. With this release the core of Harvest has been completely rewritten in Go. Harvest2 is a replacement for the older versions of Harvest 1.6 and below.

If you're using one of the Harvest 2.x release candidates, you can do a direct upgrade.

Going forward Harvest2 will follow a `year.month.fix` release naming convention with the first release being 21.05.0. See [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) for details.

**IMPORTANT** v21.05 increased Harvest's out-of-the-box security posture - self-signed certificates are rejected by default. You have two options:

 1. [Setup client certificates for each cluster](https://github.com/NetApp/harvest-private/blob/main/cmd/collectors/zapi/README.md)
 2. Disable the TLS check in Harvest. To disable, you need to edit `harvest.yml` and add `use_insecure_tls=true` to each poller or add it to the `Defaults` section. Doing so tells Harvest to ignore invalid TLS certificates.

**IMPORTANT** RPM and Debian packages will be deprecated in the future, replaced with Docker and native packages.

 **IMPORTANT** Harvest 1.6 is end of support. We recommend you upgrade to Harvest 21.05 to take advantage of the improvements.

## rc2

### Fixes
- RPM package should create Harvest user and group
- Fixed many bugs (and possibly created new ones)
- Don't restart pollers without stopping them first
- Improve XML parse time by changing ZAPI collectors to request less data from ONTAP
- Fixed race condition in the Prometheus exporter (thanks to Yann Bizeul)
- Fixed non-portable function calls that would cause Harvest to crash on ARM architectures

### Enhancements
- Add Debian package
- Improved metric architecture, eliminated race conditions in matrix data structure. This paves the way for other developers to create custom collectors
    - Matrix can be manipulated by collectors and plugins safely
    - Size of the matrix can be changed dynamically
    - Label data is collected (in early versions, at least one numeric metric was required)
- [New plugin architecture](cmd/poller/plugin/README.md) - creating new plugins is easier and existing plugins made more generic
    - You can use built-in plugins by adding rules to a collector's template. RC2 includes two built-in plugins:
      - **Aggregator**: Aggregates metrics for a given label, e.g. volume data can be used to create an aggregation at the node or SVM-level
       - **LabelAgent**: Defines rules for rewriting instance labels, creating new labels or create ignore-lists based on regular expressions

---
## rc1

 **IMPORTANT** Harvest has been rewritten in Go

 **IMPORTANT** Harvest no longer gathers data from AIQ Unified Manager. An install of AIQ.UM is not required.

### Fixes

### Enhancements
- RPM installation now conforms to a more standard Linux filesystem layout - needed to support container deployments
- Unified Grafana dashboards for cDOT and 7-mode systems
- Early release of `harvest config` tool to help you edit your `harvest.yml` file
- Add ZAPI collectors for performance, capacity and hardware metrics - gather directly from ONTAP
